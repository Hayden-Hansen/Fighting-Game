# Fighting-Game

This is the first fighting game that I built to solidify my JavaScrit skills before I moved on to my React courses!

This game was made by Chris Courses on Youtube (link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ). Chris is an amazing teacher and his tutorial will give you the necessary
foundation to begin building games in JavaScript!

Once I completed Chris' tutorial, I felt much more comfortable with class components and creating game mechanics. Chris has a bunch of game tutorials on his 
Youtube channel that will help turn you into a pro game developer!

There are a few ways that I imporved this game once I had completed it:
- In Chris' version, once a fighter has no health, they can still get in a number of hits before they hit the ground, and thus tie the game and change the outcome!
  I have corrected that. Now when a fighter runs out of health, the game freezes completely and the round is over
- Put separate strengths and weaknesses on each fighter so that there skill level matches up (left fighter cannot jump as high or draw his weapon as fast, but his hits
  do more damage. Right fighter can jump higher and draw his weapon faster, but his hits do less damage)
- Putting the controls on the site page
- Other minor UI changes


Building this game is a great way to get your foot in the door to becoming a game developer, and this is just the first of many game projects that will be on my github. Enjoy!
